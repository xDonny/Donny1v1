# Donny1v1
Remember the CoD 4 days when "I'll own you 1v1" was a catch phrase? I decided to make a 1v1 game mode for Minecraft to use with the Bukkit platform.

Continuing my learning process using the Bukkit API, it's pretty sweet that you can manipulate whatever you want, even at a packet level.

This is a 1v1 game I wrote, you can do /1v1 player and it will send a request to them, you can do 1v1 accept to fight

During the fight no other players can hurt you, and you can't hurt other players, other than your opponent of course.

Again, as with all my software on here, this is provided without warranty, use it at your own risk. I'm not to be held responsible for anything that happens as a result of using this software.
